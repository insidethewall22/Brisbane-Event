Pythagoras termed this the &#8216;Music of the Spheres&#8217;.&#160;<br /><br />Brisbane&#39;s Art Boat features the city&#39;s most unique on-water bar and performance program, with a curated program that responds to the artwork, including an evocative soundscape by Yuggera and Turrbal man and Tribal Experiences Managing Director, Shannon Ruska and a specially commissioned sound work from Lawrence English. Lindy&#8217;s stunning installation also features lighting design by Daniel Anderzipf.<br /><br />This year, Brisbane&#8217;s Art Boat will embark on special midnight and dawn cruises as well as a mindfulness program. Brisbane&#8217;s Northshore will transform into an immersive riverfront hub for Brisbane Festival. As the sun sets, the precinct will be enlivened with performances, a pop-up riverside bar and tasty eats.<br /><br />Open sessions return on Tuesday evenings, where audiences can experience the stunning installation The Spheres whilst the Art Boat is docked.<br /><br /><strong>Food and Beverage</strong><br />A range of gourmet snacks, share plates and an extensive range of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage options are available onboard the Art Boat.

The very definition of timeless elegance and bespoke excellence, Margot&#8217;s extraordinary pieces are a celebration of the world&#8217;s rarest gems.<br /><br />For four generations, the McKinney family name has been synonymous with luxury jewels. However, it is Margot herself who has elevated that name to soaring new heights through her own jewellery brand, and flagship store in Brisbane. With a practice that is rooted deeply in nurturing long-term relationships with suppliers, Margot has worked with leading pearl farmers, opal experts, and gem-cutters across the globe to secure the rare and precious materials that have been the centrepiece of her designs. The one-of-a-kind pieces are coveted by an international clientele and stocked by the prestigious Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores in the USA. The exhibition unearths stories about Margot&#8217;s illustrious career and the miracles of nature that make up her designs.<br /><br />From the coral reef in our own backyard to the rich palette of colours found on safari in Tanzania, this exhibition will be a mesmerising celebration of the complex and profoundly beautiful environments and materials that have inspired her designs.

Discover the secrets of this magnificent building which has been the setting for many cultural, social and civic events in our city&#8217;s history.<br /><br />Known as the &#8216;People&#8217;s Place&#8217;, City Hall was built between 1920 and 1930 at a cost of almost one million pounds.

A highlight is the stunning auditorium, inspired by Rome&#8217;s Pantheon, which has hosted rock stars and royalty and is home to the Father Henry Willis &amp; Sons Pipe Organ, made up of nearly 4,400 pipes. This instrument is one of only two of its kind in the world, and the auditorium continues to be integral to events that reflect our creative and connected city.<br /><br />City Hall is a working civic building and some areas may be unavailable at certain times.<br /><br />Tour begins in the King George Square foyer on the ground floor of City Hall.<br /><br />Duration of tour: 45mins<br />Capacity: 20 people<br />Difficulty: This tour is suitable for all fitness levels and abilities.

With its impressive neo-classical fa&#231;ade, mosaic tiles, stained-glass windows and soaring ceilings, Brisbane&#8217;s heritage-listed City Hall is at the heart of our city. Discover the secrets of this magnificent building which has been the setting for many cultural, social and civic events in our city&#8217;s history.<br /><br />Known as the &#8216;People&#8217;s Place&#8217;, City Hall was built between 1920 and 1930 at a cost of almost one million pounds. At the time it was the second largest construction project in Australia, second only to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. A highlight is the stunning auditorium, inspired by Rome&#8217;s Pantheon, which has hosted rock stars and royalty and is home to the Father Henry Willis &amp; Sons Pipe Organ, made up of nearly 4,400 pipes. This instrument is one of only two of its kind in the world, and the auditorium continues to be integral to events that reflect our creative and connected city.<br /><br />City Hall is a working civic building and some areas may be unavailable at certain times.<br /><br />Tour begins in the King George Square foyer on the ground floor of City Hall.<br /><br />Duration of tour: 45mins<br />Capacity: 20 people<br />Difficulty: This tour is suitable for all fitness levels and abilities.

The very definition of timeless elegance and bespoke excellence, Margot&#8217;s extraordinary pieces are a celebration of the world&#8217;s rarest gems.<br /><br />For four generations, the McKinney family name has been synonymous with luxury jewels. However, it is Margot herself who has elevated that name to soaring new heights through her own jewellery brand, and flagship store in Brisbane. With a practice that is rooted deeply in nurturing long-term relationships with suppliers, Margot has worked with leading pearl farmers, opal experts, and gem-cutters across the globe to secure the rare and precious materials that have been the centrepiece of her designs. The one-of-a-kind pieces are coveted by an international clientele and stocked by the prestigious Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores in the USA. The exhibition unearths stories about Margot&#8217;s illustrious career and the miracles of nature that make up her designs.<br /><br />From the coral reef in our own backyard to the rich palette of colours found on safari in Tanzania, this exhibition will be a mesmerising celebration of the complex and profoundly beautiful environments and materials that have inspired her designs. Here you&#8217;ll find opulent opals, lustrous pearls and rare gems like the intensely blue tanzanite, lilac amethyst and pink tourmalines.<br /><br />World of Wonder is the fourth exhibition in MoB&#8217;s identity series that celebrates creative greats who call Brisbane home, including Mao&#8217;s Last Dancer the Exhibition: A Portrait of Li Cunxin, a spotlight on designers Pamela Easton and Lydia Pearson for Pattern &amp; Print: Easton Pearson Archive, and High Rotation &#8211; an exhibition celebrating over 100 musicians over the last three decades.

Discover the secrets of this magnificent building which has been the setting for many cultural, social and civic events in our city&#8217;s history.<br /><br />Known as the &#8216;People&#8217;s Place&#8217;, City Hall was built between 1920 and 1930 at a cost of almost one million pounds.

A highlight is the stunning auditorium, inspired by Rome&#8217;s Pantheon, which has hosted rock stars and royalty and is home to the Father Henry Willis &amp; Sons Pipe Organ, made up of nearly 4,400 pipes. This instrument is one of only two of its kind in the world, and the auditorium continues to be integral to events that reflect our creative and connected city.<br /><br />City Hall is a working civic building and some areas may be unavailable at certain times.<br /><br />Tour begins in the King George Square foyer on the ground floor of City Hall.<br /><br />Duration of tour: 45mins<br />Capacity: 20 people<br />Difficulty: This tour is suitable for all fitness levels and abilities.
